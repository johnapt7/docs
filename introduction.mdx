# Introduction to Partner Adapters

Partner Adapters provide a unified interface for integrating with various payment providers, making it easy to support multiple payment methods and platforms in your application.

## What are Partner Adapters?

Partner Adapters are pre-built integration modules that standardize the way your application interacts with different payment providers. Each adapter handles the specific requirements and APIs of its respective partner while exposing a consistent interface to your application.

## Why Use Partner Adapters?

## Supported Partners

We currently support the following payment partners:

- **Amazon**: Amazon Pay and subscription management
- **Boku**: Mobile carrier billing and direct payments
- **Roku**: Streaming platform payments and subscriptions
- **iTunes**: Apple App Store payments and in-app purchases
- **Google**: Google Play billing and subscriptions

## Core Concepts

### Adapters

Each adapter is a self-contained module that:
- Handles authentication with the partner
- Implements standard operations (purchase, upgrade, downgrade, cancel)
- Manages webhooks and notifications
- Provides error handling and retry logic

### Flows

All adapters support four core transaction flows:

1. **Purchase**: Create new transactions or subscriptions
2. **Upgrade**: Move customers to higher-tier plans
3. **Downgrade**: Move customers to lower-tier plans
4. **Cancel**: End subscriptions or refund transactions

### Configuration

Adapters use a standard configuration format:

```json
{
  "adapter": "partner-name",
  "config": {
    "clientId": "your-client-id",
    "clientSecret": "your-client-secret",
    "environment": "production",
    "webhookUrl": "https://yourapp.com/webhooks"
  }
}
```
