## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before integrating the Amazon adapter, ensure you have:

- Amazon Seller account with payment processing enabled
- API credentials (Client ID and Secret)
- Webhook endpoints configured

### Basic Configuration

```json
{
  "adapter": "amazon",
  "config": {
    "clientId": "your-client-id",
    "clientSecret": "your-client-secret",
    "environment": "production",
    "region": "us-east-1"
  }
}
```

## Integration Steps

1. **Configure Credentials**: Set up your Amazon API credentials
2. **Initialize Adapter**: Create an instance of the Amazon adapter
3. **Implement Flows**: Add support for purchase, upgrade, downgrade, and cancel operations
4. **Set Up Webhooks**: Configure webhook handlers for real-time updates
5. **Test Integration**: Thoroughly test all flows in sandbox environment

## Security Considerations

<Warning>
Always store sensitive credentials securely using environment variables or a secure vault service. Never commit credentials to version control.
</Warning>

## Rate Limits

Amazon enforces the following rate limits:
- **API Calls**: 100 requests per second
- **Webhook Deliveries**: 50 per second
- **Batch Operations**: 10 concurrent requests

<Note>
Rate limits may vary based on your Amazon seller tier. Contact Amazon support for higher limits.
</Note>

## Error Handling

The Amazon adapter provides standardized error responses:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "PAYMENT_DECLINED",
    "message": "The payment method was declined",
    "details": {
      "reason": "insufficient_funds",
      "amazonErrorCode": "DeclinedPaymentMethod"
    }
  }
}
```
